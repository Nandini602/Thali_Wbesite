      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 1996, TheThaliHouse was born out of a love for traditional Indian cuisine and a desire to bring the authentic taste of India to the heart of Pune. Our founder, Naresh  Desai, grew up enjoying homemade thalis passed down through generations, and this inspired the vision to create a place where people could experience Indiaâ€™s rich culinary heritage. With a passion for blending tradition and innovation, we have created a menu that offers a diverse range of thalis from every corner of India, all served in a warm and welcoming environment.
